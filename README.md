### Goals

- compare song features of jazz artists in six different categories (e.g. I can see that the songs by artist x tend to be more uptempo than the average popular jazz song);
- Analyze the most popular  jazz artists’ productivity by viewing their released songs over the years;
see the number of jazz songs released over the years;
- explore jazz songs in a timeline, and compare their selected audio features;
listen to a preview of the tracks; 
- explore the temporal context of jazz songs (which tracks were released at this time);
discover new jazz tracks from a specific time range.
